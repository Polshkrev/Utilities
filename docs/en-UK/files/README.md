## Description
A package that deals with operations performed on files; such as comparing, zipping, or preprocessing.

## File

A module that has three functions. One to zip a file, one to extract a file, and another to compare two text files.

## Preprocess

At the moment all this module does is converts a cammel case: `someFunctionOrVariable` to snake case &mdash; the default in python &mdash; : `some_function_or_variable`. This problem primarily comes from analyzing the StackOverflow Developers Survey.
