## Description
This package is designed to cut down on the repetative nature of some python practices such as logging, type hinting, and file management. The name of the package &mdash; polutils &mdash; is a pun on the russian word "получилось" (paloocheelas) meaning "it happened", or "it turned out to be." The name also combines the first few letters of my name and "utils".
